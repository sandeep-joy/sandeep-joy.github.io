I am a Quantum Initiative postdoctoral fellow at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and Florida State University. My research focuses on theoretical condensed matter physics, with a primary emphasis on exploring quantum materials. I am especially interested in two-dimensional electron systems, where Coulomb interactions and quantum geometry drive novel phases and phase transitions.

I completed my Ph.D. at The Ohio State University, where I worked with Prof. [Brian Skinner](https://sites.google.com/view/skinner-physics) in the Physics Department. Currently, I am formally supervised by Prof. [Cyprian Lewandowski](https://physics.fsu.edu/person/cyprian-lewandowski) but actively collaborate with theorists and experimentalists both at my home institution and beyond.
